# {project-name}

Honeycomb wrapper for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) in the browser.

This package sets up OpenTelemetry for tracing, using our recommended practices, including:

* Useful fields about the browser situation
* Easy configuration to send to Honeycomb
* Basic sampler to control event volume
* Convenient packaging
* An informative debug mode, including links to traces in Honeycomb

// TODO: ask Phillip whether we must call this a distro instead of a wrapper. It's a wrapper.
